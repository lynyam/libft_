# libft_
Libft is a custom C library developed for the 42 curriculum. It replicates standard C functions (e.g., string manipulation, memory management) and includes utilities like linked lists. This project builds a strong foundation in C programming, focusing on memory handling and core data structures.

Contents:

Standard Library Functions:

String manipulation (ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, etc.)
Memory management (ft_memset, ft_bzero, etc.)
Type conversions (ft_atoi, ft_itoa, etc.)
Comparison functions (ft_strcmp, ft_memcmp, etc.)
Utility Functions:

Linked lists (ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, etc.)
File handling (ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, etc.)
Additional functions to extend the standard library functionality.
Objectives
This project provides a deep understanding of memory management in C, strengthens algorithmic skills, and lays a solid foundation for more advanced projects at 42.

Usage:

To use this library in your projects, compile it using make, and include the libft.h header file in your source files. The libft functions are designed to be used interchangeably with those of the standard C library.
